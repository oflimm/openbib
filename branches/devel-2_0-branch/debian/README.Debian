openbib for Debian
------------------

Due to the circumstance that German libraries with their
german-specific meta-data formats (MAB) and bibliographic standards
(RAK) are the primary target of this application at this point with no
MARC21/AACR2 support it might not be of much use in NON-MAB2/RAK countries.
On the other hand, everybody is free to port it to MARC21/AACR2 and let
me integrate the patches.
